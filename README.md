What I have done in my free time!

I wrote this code while studing at Digipen Institute of Technology

Most of this code is not commented, finished, or remotely started.  They may contain bugs, hard to read code, things you would not do in a develpoment enviroment, etc.

This code should not be used in a development enviroment, I only ever use it as a reference to build off of.
