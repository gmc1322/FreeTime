# FreeTime
What I have done in my free time!

Most of this code is not commented, finished, or even remotly started.  They are may contain a lot of bugs, hard to read code, things you normally should never do, etc. It is just ment to show what I do in my free time!

This code should not be used in a development enviroment, I only ever use it as a reference to build of off.
